        means samba on the feet. It comes from the favelas of Brazil, and it
        accurately depicts the distinct heritage of the Brazilian people. This
        type of samba is commonly danced impromptu whenever samba music comes
        on. It is mostly associated with Brazilian carnival; however, it is not
        limited to that particular setting. It may be danced in all kinds of
        environments like concerts and music festivals as long as the music is
        right.
        <br />
        This style of samba is often danced unaccompanied, and it starts as soon
        as the music comes on. There are fast samba and a slower variation, but
        the pace will ultimately depend on the music. If you’ve never tried
        Samba before, you should! It’s an energetic and super fun type of dance
        and involves cute costumes too. Book your class today!
